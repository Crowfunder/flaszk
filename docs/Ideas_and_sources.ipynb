    "1. Before starting algorithm we check if right ip address was given by user (does it exist in our network)\n",
    "2. send message to check if it is busy right now (synchronising) - next steps depends on approach to multithreading.\n",
    "3. if not proceed to 4, otherwise wait. After 30 sec show message 'Try again later' to user \n",
    "4. It will be implemented as it is shown on this [website]('https://medium.com/@oferrivlin/the-three-pass-protocol-magic-e84614827ef0') K is id of of connection that can be used in the next steps 'Do we want to encode our files before sending?'\n",
